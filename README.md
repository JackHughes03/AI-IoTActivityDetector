# AI-IoTActivityDetector
An artificial intelligence model/program for IoT devices to detect activities.

## Uses
This model can be used by IoT devices to detect activies such as running, walking, and driving.

## How to implement
THe model operates on the "Speed (km/h)", "Heading", "Altitude (m)", and "Total Distance (km)" columns.
1. Extract the model.pkl file and all .csv files into your directory.
